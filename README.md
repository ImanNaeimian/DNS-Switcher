🔮 Future Update Idea
In future versions, I plan to add a feature that allows users to create their own custom DNS profiles.

🛠️ Here’s how it will work:

1. You will enter a name for your DNS profile.

2. Then you’ll add the primary DNS address.

3. Next, you’ll add the secondary DNS address.

Once saved, your custom DNS will appear in the menu, and you can use it anytime — just like the default ones.
